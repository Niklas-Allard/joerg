## Description:

This is a simple PHP application that simplifies the life for handycapped people. It is a desktop like application but browser based. It is designed to help people with disabilities to use the file manager. The users can watch videos, listen to music, read text files, and view images. The application uses the text-to-speech feature to simplify the use of the file manager.

## Installation

To install the application, you need to install some depedencies. The application uses the following depedencies:

- xammp
- PHP
- Python
- pyttsx3

### XAMPP

XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.  
You can download xammp from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

## Follow the following steps:

1. Got to *config*
2. enable *apache* in the module *autostart of modules*
3. enable *Start Control Panel Minimized*
4. press *save*

### PHP

PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development. Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the most popular websites in the world.  
You can download PHP from [here](https://www.php.net/downloads)

### Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.  
You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### pyttsx3

pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline, and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.  
You can install pyttsx3 by running the following command: `pip install pyttsx3`

## Configurations

### Styling

For optimising the user experience in the programm

You may style the programm with the following site, which is only accessible through the URL (`localhost/your-directory-name/settings.php`)

There you can see all important styling parameters with a hopefully understandable descripting what it does

### Important Information

There is an JSON file (`user_data.json`), a file for storing data which contains the most important information for running the programm.

Please edit only the named data, this is very important for running th app.

A quick dive into the structure of JSON. JSON is structured in a key value format, that means for example there is a key of `main_path` and the value is then the path to all the important video and audio files.

The following must be edited or should be:

- `main_path` | the value is the absolute or realtive path to all the files
- `path_link` | this will be descripted later in more detail
- `path_background` (optional; recommended) | here you need to giv the programm the relative or absolute path to a picture which will be shown at the starting page. It must be at the same drive of this programm
- `tts_speed` | the `tts_speed` defines the speed of the audio output from the Text-To-Speech AI Model. Just try some number. The standart is *200*
- `show_title` | if true on every card is an title if false there is no title shown
- `python_path` | the python path is an important part if you have any problem with running `python --version` in the terminal
- `browser` | we highly recommend using edge but if you really want you can also use firefox (no other browse is supported by us). To select the browser please write `edge` or `firefox` exact. If you use another browser just try around by switching these two values, it only changes the behaviour at the site where you can watch videos
- `log` (not fully working at the time) | if true there are logs stored which you can see at `localhost/your-directory-name/controls.php`
